## Part 1: Surface Energy Balance

## Part 3: Los Angeles Neighborhoods

```{r data, include=FALSE}
la <- read.csv("Bren203_F18_LA_Data - Bren203_F18_LA_Data.csv")

```

### Temperature and NDVI 

- What is NDVI? 
- What should we expect from this relationship? 
- What does a high NDVI tell us about a neighborhood's water use? 

```{r temp_veg, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(la, aes(x=temp_mean, y=ndvi_mean, col=median_inc)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  scale_color_gradient(low="red", high="green") + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, col='black', show.legend = T) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle("Temp. v. NDVI by neighborhood and median income") + 
  ylab("average NDVI") + 
  xlab("average temperature (deg C)")

ggplot(la, aes(x=temp_mean, y=ndvi_mean, col=(1-pct_white))) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  scale_color_gradient(low="red", high="green") + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, col='black', show.legend = T) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle("Temp. v. NDVI by neighborhood and minority population") + 
  ylab("average NDVI") + 
  xlab("average temperature (deg C)")


```

- Do you think there is a relationship here? 
- What do you think prevents us from finding a correlation?
- What other relationships did you find?

Tayyebi and Jenerette found that NDVI and LST were negatively correlated across coastal, inland, and desert zones:
